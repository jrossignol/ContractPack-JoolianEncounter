TEXT BOX (upon accepting contract): The story so far...

<Show a picture of the monolith near Jool>

It has been many years since $STARJEB and $SURVIVOR's fated encounter with the Jool Monolith.  The public are led to believe that $STARJEB died exploring Jool.  Few who know the truth of what happened at Jool believe it.

$SURVIVOR returned home a hero, but their story of $STARJEB becoming an immortal being known as "The Star Jeb" seem like the ravings of a Kerbal trapped alone in space for too long.  The Administration has quietly grounded him, but don't dare openly fire him from the space program.

The monoliths have gone silent, their strange signals no longer transmitted towards Jool.  But, how long will it be before they activate again?  The encounter at Jool has started something that cannot be stopped...
